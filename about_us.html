            <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-8">In the heart of a bustling city, Rohit, Riddhi,
                and
                Adithi discovered a shared passion for gardening amidst the concrete landscape. Starting with a humble
                rooftop
                garden, they transformed a small urban space into a thriving oasis of greenery. As their garden
                flourished,
                so did their desire to share their knowledge and passion with others. </p>
            <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-8">Driven by their belief that everyone should have
                the
                opportunity to experience the joy of gardening, Rohit, Riddhi, and Adithi founded Home Gardening. Their
                mission: to simplify the art of gardening and make it accessible to urban dwellers and beginners alike.
                Through practical advice, expert guidance, and curated products, Home Gardening has grown into a trusted
                resource for garden enthusiasts around the world. </p>
            <p class="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-800 leading-7 mb-8">Today, Home Gardening continues to nurture a
                community of like-minded individuals who share a love for plants and a commitment to sustainable living.
                Rohit, Riddhi, and Adithi's journey from rooftop gardeners to founders of a global gardening community
                reflects their dedication to fostering a greener, more connected world through the simple act of
                gardening.
